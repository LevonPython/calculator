Introduction
============

This application is a copied version of windows standard calculator. 
The application is written in python (used libraries: Tkinter, os, math).

* The  `Tkinter <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html>`_ package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. 
* The `os <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html>` module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. 
* The `math <https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html>` module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.  

============
Problems the application is solving
============
The aim of creating this application is to make application with the same functionalities and interface as in Windows calculator.

============
Installation
============
There is no installation needed if you have python >3.0 version already installed in your computer.


============
How it works
============
Just run the  `calculator_OOP.py <https://github.com/LevonPython/calculator/blob/main/calculator_OOP.py>`_ or `calculator.py <https://github.com/LevonPython/calculator/blob/main/calculator.py>`_ file via any python interpreter.
These 2 files are the same in point of functionality, difference is only in structure, as in `calculator_OOP.py <https://github.com/LevonPython/calculator/blob/main/calculator_OOP.py>`_ script is written in Object Oriented Programming form.


============
Bug reporting
============

Create Github issue. Please write versions of your Windows, OS and python.
